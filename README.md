Example for compiling and debugging WebAssembly compiled C++.

Please note that the tools for doing this seem to be a work in progress, and
the user experience will not be that great yet.

Requires emscripten SDK to be installed at `~/emsdk`. You can probably symlink
it if it's installed elsewhere. Installation instructions at
https://emscripten.org.

I personally recommend not getting into debugger setup too much until tooling
is more mature. All of this is very new stuff, and the example here will
perhaps fall out of date quickly.
